## Introduction

In this chapter, we will take our collections to the next dimension. Literally. We'll look at how to store collections of information that is more complex than a simple ordered List of objects.

Think for example of a digital representation of Stockholm's Metro Network:

<img width="711" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/152983698-22fb9246-311b-4470-bef2-49442e330057.png">

You could store the information in multiple Arrays, maybe:

```cs
Station[] T13 = new Station[] {
   Norsborg, Hallunda, Allby, ...
};
Station[] T14 = new Station[] {
   Fru√§ngen, V√§stertorp, ...
};
```

But then, if you wanted to see, where you can go from T-Centralen, you'd have to run over all lists to check, whether your station is part of that line:

<details>
  <summary>Pseudo-Code</summary>

```
Procedure find_connected_stations
   lines ‚Üê array of all lines
   startStation ‚Üê station to search connections for
   result ‚Üê empty array of stations

   for each line in lines
      for each station in line
         if station = startStation
            add previousStation to result
            add nextStation to result
         end if
      end for
   end for

   return result
end procedure
```

</details>

That would be the equivalent of looking at multiple separate maps for each line and requiring to find your station in each of those:

<img src ="https://stockholmmetro.com/assets/images/green-line.jpg">

Pretty annoying, or? The original map is much more useful. As soon as you found your station, you can see all connections at one glance:

```cs

public class Connection {
   public Station target;
   public Line line;
   public Station source;
}

public class Station {
   public string name;
   public Connection[] connections;
}
```

We'll look at how we can define a structure like this in code and use it to structure a very useful type of collection for sorted data.

## Excellent Criteria
There is no passing criteria associated with this course. This information will be validated through the Pathfinding exercises.

## Bonus
Design a Graph for (a part of) Stockholm's Subway System. There is:
- Stations
  - With Names
- Connections
  - From one Station to another Station
  - With a Name for the Line you're taking
  - And a Duration, how long it'd take

Now, implement a small application where you start at T-Centralen and:
- It prints all possible connections from here
- You can choose, which one to take
- Then, it updates your current station
- And repeats (loops back)

Example Output:
```
You're at T-Centralen. Possible Connections:
0: T14 to Gamla Stan (2 Minutes)
1: T17 to Gamla Stan (2 Minutes)
2: T14 to √ñstermalmstorg (3 Minutes)
3: T17 to H√∂torget (4 Minutes)
Which  one do you want to take?
Input: 1
You're at Gamla Stan. Possible Connections:
...
```
